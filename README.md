# mongoDBcourseExcersises
collection of my code for the Udemy 'mongo DB for becoming a full stack Developer' by Stephen Grider

currently on Section 9 lecture 9
i am in the CLI and inside the 'muber' directory when i run the command 'npm run test'

''mocha'' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

this code is written with nodemon mocha and mongoose being installed and listed as dependencies in the config file as well.
i have a windows 10 operating system, my CLI if it helps is gitbash.
